You can quiz yourself via the quiz option which will ask you true/false or fill in the blank questions. You can also learn about more about computers, internet browsers, social media, and online safety by selecting one of those options. Each information option is broken into three subtopics. &#xA;&#xA;You can also search for a nearby library that may be able to offer you more resources through an option located on the same options menu used to get to this screen.</string>
